This problem arose when I needed to split my PDF files from my remarkable 2 into multiple A4 sheets to be printed out. I couldn't find a single website that does this, so I made my own instead

It will first ask for a file path in the terminal (persuming you just copy the PDF you want ot edit by path, you can also leave the "" marks on the path)

If a valid path has been found, it will open to show the document and a few buttons

The picture of the PDF file can be scrolled up and down on, the black lines on it shows where it will be cut (they are automatically put in to cut the most A4 sheets possible)
the green and red boxes show if the split line is too far from another line (might need to scroll to refresh colours), the file won't split if there are red boxes

The top most text box is what line you would like to change and the second input box is how much you'd like to move it by. You then move them with the up and down arrows

Add and delete adds a line on the bottom and delete delets the last one (you can only delete lines you have added)

The enter name text box will be the name you set it to 

the slice button will then cut  up the file as you have edited it

The file will automatically be transfered into your downloads folder
